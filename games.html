<p>I bring to you Super Mario Hammer, with 8 worlds with 4 levels each.
<br>I didn't consider the other characters, but I suppose you could play it with characters other than Mario if you want to.
<br>Going back to the first level in a world if you get a game over is optional; if you want to play like that, I have sprinkled in a decent amount of coins and 1-ups in the levels.
<br>Also, for you Koopas the Quick and Il Piantissimos out there, here's a fun challenge: my speed run record is <i>23:23.23</i>.

However, he changed the names of the pieces of music, thesaurusizingly. <i>Diricos</i> commented on the video 
"Ah yes, the Tune of Tempests - one of my favorite themes from Story of Girl!"
<br>
So I made Story of Girl a real thing. Here it is
